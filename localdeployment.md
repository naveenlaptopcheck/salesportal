# To deploy a Docker container on your local machine using code from a GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1\. Install Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your local
machine. You can download and install Docker from the official Docker
website (https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2\. Clone the GitHub repository: Clone the repository containing the
Docker code you want to deploy. You can use the following command to
clone the repository:

# \`\`\`shell git clone \<repository-url\> \`\`\`

3\. Navigate to the repository: Change your current working directory to
the cloned repository.

# \`\`\`shell cd \<repository-directory\> \`\`\`

4\. Build the Docker image: Use the Dockerfile provided in the
repository to build a Docker image. Run the following command:

# \`\`\`shell docker build -t \<image-name\> . \`\`\`Replace \`\<image-name\>\` 
with the desired name for your Docker image.

5\. Run the Docker container: Once the Docker image is built, you can
run it as a container using the following command:

# \`\`\`shell docker run -d -p \<host-port\>:\<container-port\> \<image-name\> \`\`\`

Replace \`\<host-port\>\` with the port number on your local machine
where you want to access the containerized application. Replace
\`\<container-port\>\` with the port number specified in the Dockerfile
or required by your application. Finally, replace \`\<image-name\>\`
with the name you provided in the previous step.

6\. Access the application: You can now access the deployed application
by opening a web browser and navigating to
# \`http://localhost:\<host-port\>\`

 where \`\<host-port\>\` is the port
you specified in the previous step.

By following these steps, you should be able to deploy a Docker
container on your local machine using code from a GitHub repository.

# Reference Docker and github setup locally:

To set up GitHub and Docker locally, you\'ll need to follow these steps:

# Setting up GitHub locally: 
1. Create a GitHub account if you don\'t have
one already. 2. Install Git on your local machine. You can download it
from the official Git website 
 # (https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

3.Configure your Git username and email by opening a terminal or command
prompt and running the following commands: 
# \`\`\` git config \--global user.name \"Your Name\" 
# git config \--global user.email \"your@email.com\" \`\`\` 

4. Generate an SSH key to securely
authenticate with GitHub. Run the following command in the terminal or
command prompt: 
# \`\`\` ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.com\" \`\`\` 

5. Press Enter to accept the default file location and enter a
passphrase (optional) when prompted. 6. Add your SSH key to the SSH
agent. Run the following command: 
# \`\`\` eval \"\$(ssh-agent -s)\"
# ssh-add \~/.ssh/id_ed25519 \`\`\` 

7. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard
by running the following command: 
# \`\`\` clip \< \~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \`\`\` 

8. Go to your GitHub account settings
(https://github.com/settings/keys) and click on \"New SSH key.\" 9. Give
your key a title and paste the copied key into the \"Key\" field. Click
\"Add SSH key.\"

# Now your local machine is set up to work with GitHub.



# Setting up Docker locally: 

1. Download and install Docker Desktop for
your operating system from the official Docker website
# (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). 
2. Run the Docker
Desktop installer and follow the instructions to complete the
installation. 

3. Once Docker Desktop is installed, launch it from your
applications or system tray.

4\. Docker should start up and display a whale icon in the system tray
or menu bar when it\'s ready. 

5. Verify the Docker installation by
opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
# \`\`\` docker version \`\`\` 

6. You should see the version information
for both the Docker client and server.

# Now Docker is set up on your local machine.
